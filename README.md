## Features

### üÜï v0.6.0 - Selection-Based Workflow

- **Dual operation modes**: Traditional modal input OR instant selection-based execution

### Core Features
- **Ask Claude about your notes**: Send your current note content along with a question to Claude
- **Cursor position insertion**: Claude's response is automatically inserted at your cursor position (when no selection)
- **Selection replacement**: Replace selected text with Claude's response (when text is selected)
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

- **Debug tools**: Built-in testing and debugging capabilities
